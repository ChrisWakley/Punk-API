An API based website built in react.

In this project i used: HTML, CSS, SCSS and javascript.

This project was a challenge for me, writing out the functionality to filter and switch between displays was something i wasn't originally comfortable with,
since finishing this project, I am far more confident with creating components that work with eachother for desired effect.

if I were to do any further work on this project, I'd refine the look of the page itself and add further filter options.

On the whole, I am very happy with how this project has turned out.
